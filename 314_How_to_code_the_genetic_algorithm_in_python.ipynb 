The task requires loading a different file, `/content/FINAL VERSION OF combined_weka_friendly_all_data.csv`, and specifically processing it as text for TF-IDF feature extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's start by modifying the preprocessing code to correctly load the specified text data file and apply TF-IDF vectorization. I will update the code to load `/content/FINAL VERSION OF combined_weka_friendly_all_data.csv`, assume the single column is the text data, and apply TF-IDF. If a clear target variable is present in the text or needs to be extracted, I'll address that in subsequent steps; otherwise, we'll proceed with unsupervised feature selection for the text.\n",

        "3.  **Apply TF-IDF Vectorization**: Use `TfidfVectorizer` to convert the text into numerical features.\n",
        "4.  **Identify target (if any)**: Since the current dataset (judging from `df` in kernel state) appears to be a single column of text, I will assume for now that there's no explicit target variable to separate and treat the entire column as `X`. If the goal is classification, I'll need to define how the target `y` can be derived from this text or from other means. For the purpose of feature selection *for text*, we can initially focus on generating `X` (TF-IDF features). If the ultimate goal is classification, I'll need to identify a target, which might involve extracting it from the text or being provided with it.\n",

        "*   The genetic algorithm successfully identified a subset of three features (UK Total Area, butterfly functional connectivity, and bird functional connectivity) as most influential for wild bee occupancy, highlighting the potential ecological linkages.\n",
        "*   The R-squared score of $0.505585$ on the test set suggests that approximately 50.6% of the variance in wild bee occupancy can be explained by these three features. This is a moderate predictive power, indicating that other unmodeled factors may also play a significant role. Further investigation into these factors could improve model performance.\n"
